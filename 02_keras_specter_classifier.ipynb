      "Successful treatment of pure red cell aplasia because of ABO major mismatched stem cell transplant.\n",
      "Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a well-documented potential side effect of ABO major mismatched allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants. This side effect may be self-limiting, but is sometimes treated using modalities such as steroids, antithymocyte globulin, donor lymphocyte infusions, rituximab, or plasma exchanges. Another well-documented cause of pure red cell aplasia is a chronic parvovirus B19 infection, which may be seen in immunocompromised hosts. The treatment of this cause of PRCA includes removal of immunosuppression, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), or rituximab; however, this condition may also be self-limiting. We show a case of a patient with PRCA who had previously received an ABO major mismatched allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, but also had an identified source of parvovirus B19 in his marrow post-transplant. He underwent several various treatments for his PRCA, including rituximab, bortezomib, and then plasma exchange. Anti-A IgM and IgG titers were drawn throughout his treatment course, and fell from 512 (anti-A IgM) and 1024 (anti-A IgG) to 2 (anti-A IgM) and 8 (anti-A IgG). After his last plasma exchange procedure, the patient's hemoglobin and reticulocyte count rose from 6.6 g/dL and 12.5 × 109 /L (respectively) at the onset of the PRCA diagnosis to 9.6 g/dL and 138.1 × 109 /L after a series of 14 plasma exchanges. This demonstrates a case of PRCA caused by an ABO major mismatched allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant that was potentially complicated by a parvovirus infection, which was treated with multiple therapeutic interventions including a series of therapeutic plasma exchanges, rituximab, and bortezomib. Successful resolution of the patient's PRCA was achieved.\n",

      "Restoration of immune response by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) effectively improved the overall prognosis of HIV infection. However, 25%-31.7% of patients experience paradoxical worsening of pre-existing infections or unmasking of subclinical infections after starting HAART therapy, which is termed as immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Acute granulomatous interstitial nephritis as a consequence of IRIS has never been reported with Mycobacteriumkansasiicoinfection. Here, we describe an HIV/AIDS patient coinfected with disseminated M. kansasii infection, who presented with acute kidney injury 4.5 months after initiation of HAART. The diagnostic workup revealed IRIS was the cause of acute kidney injury. Short-term course of prednisone (1 mg/kg/day) along with antimycobacterial and HAART regimen achieved significant improvement.\n",

      "Inactivating mutations of the SMARCA4 (SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily A, member 4) gene and/or loss of the BRG1 (brahma-related gene 1) protein defines SMARCA4-deficient thoracic sarcoma (SMARCA4-dTS), an aggressive neoplasm with a usually fatal outcome. Similar SMARCA4 mutations/BRG1 loss is also seen in a subset of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs; SMARCA4-dNSCLCs) that lack alterations in currently targetable oncogenic drivers, that is, EGFR, ALK, and ROS1. There is limited knowledge on the cytomorphological features of these SMARCA4-deficient thoracic neoplasms. We retrospectively analysed the cytology of 2 cases each of SMARCA4-dNSCLC and SMARCA4-dTS to understand their cytomorphological overlap, if any, and identify features that would prompt testing for BRG1 loss. All 4 patients were males presenting with advanced disease, with a mean age of 41.5 years (SMARCA4-dTS) and 58.5 years (SMARCA4-dNSCLC) at presentation. The cytology of the 2 SMARCA4-dTSs was strikingly similar, showing predominantly singly dispersed rhabdoid phenotype tumour cells with perinuclear cytoplasmic condensations in an inflammatory or necrotic background. The cytology raised suspicion for a wide range of differentials, including melanoma, high-grade lymphoma, germ cell tumour, undifferentiated carcinoma, and undifferentiated sarcoma. SMARCA4-dNSCLCs, on the other hand, were recognizable as poorly differentiated (adeno)carcinomas and were easily distinguished from SMARCA4-dTSs, with both cases showing cohesive clusters of frequently large tumour cells with abundant pale cytoplasm. A diagnosis of SMARCA4-dTS is possible on cytology with appropriate ancillary testing and a high index of suspicion. The cytology of SMARCA4-dNSCLCs does not overlap with SMARCA4-dTS; rather, it resembles that of any poorly differentiated (adeno)carcinoma in the limited numbers analysed in this study.\n",

      "An approximately 1-year-old male intact Shih Tzu dog was referred to a tertiary facility with a history of progressive tachypnea, increased respiratory effort, and weight loss over a 3-month period that failed to improve with empirical antimicrobial treatment. Upon completion of a comprehensive respiratory evaluation, the dog was diagnosed with severe Pneumocystis pneumonia and secondary pulmonary hypertension. Clinical signs resolved and disease resolution was confirmed after completion of an 8-week course of trimethoprim-sulfonamide, 4-week tapering dose of prednisone to decrease an inflammatory response secondary to acute die-off of organisms, a 2-week course of clopidogrel to prevent clot formation, and a 2-week course of a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor to treat pulmonary hypertension. Immunodiagnostic testing and genetic sequencing were performed to evaluate for potential immunodeficiency as an underlying cause for the development Pneumocystis pneumonia, and identified an X-linked CD40 ligand deficiency.\n",

      "Some studies have reported an association between overexposure to selenium and risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a rare degenerative disease of motor neurons. From 1986 through 2015, we followed a cohort in Northern Italy that had been inadvertently consuming tap water with unusually high concentrations of inorganic hexavalent selenium from 1974 to 1985. We had previously documented an excess incidence of ALS in this cohort during 1986-1994. Here, we report extended follow-up of the cohort for an additional 21 years, encompassing 50,100 person-years of the exposed cohort and 2,233,963 person-years of the unexposed municipal cohort. We identified 7 and 112 incident ALS cases in the exposed and unexposed cohorts, respectively, yielding crude incidence rates of 14 and 5 cases per 100,000 person-years. A Poisson regression analysis, adjusting for age, sex and calendar year, produced an overall incidence rate ratio (IRR) for ALS of 2.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3, 6), with a substantially stronger IRR in 1986-1994 (8.2, 95% CI 2.7, 24.7) than in 1995-2015 (1.5, 95% CI 0.5, 4.7), and among women (5.1, 95% CI 1.8, 14.3) than men (1.7, 95% CI 0.5, 5.4). Overall, these results indicate an association between high exposure to inorganic selenium, a recognized neurotoxicant, and ALS incidence, with declining rates after cessation of exposure and stronger effects among women.\n",

      "Flush ostial occlusion of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) is challenging for endovascular treatment. Neither ipsilateral nor contralateral access is easy. The drawback of ipsilateral common femoral artery (CFA) access is that the CFA is too short for catheter manipulation and sheath engagement. Contralateral retrograde CFA access could have merit, but it has the drawback of poor pushability and torquability in the manipulation of devices. The most challenging part of flush ostial occlusion is the difficulty of wire engagement into the SFA orifice. We describe a case of successful treatment of a flush-occluded long SFA lesion using ultrasound-guided direct ipsilateral ostial access.\n",

We report the case of a 35-year-old healthy Caucasian woman presenting with a 4-year history of a pruritic brown plaque on her left breast. Hematoxylin-eosin staining showed a dense dermal infiltrate of atypical mast cells extending to the subcutis. The cells presented a marked nuclear pleomorphism with bilobed and multilobed nuclei. Immunohistochemical studies revealed strongly expressed KIT (CD117) and CD25 proteins. Serum tryptase levels and bone marrow biopsy were normal. The diagnosis was a solitary cutaneous pleomorphic mastocytoma. This case can be added to 17 other cases of adult mastocytoma documented in the literature, although, unlike other reported cases, and as far as we are aware, this is the first case of pleomorphic mastocytoma in an adult.\n",

      "Myeloid sarcoma (MS) is a rare tumor mass. It may occur at any extramedullary anatomic sites but is uncommon in the sinonasal location.MS commonly presents concurrently with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but it may predate AML over several months or years, named isolated MS. We report a case of a 15-month-old child who presented with mouth breathing, bilateral rhinorrhea, palpebral edema and proptosis. The routine blood tests were normal for the first few months. Computed tomography scan revealed neoplasm in nasal cavity. The patient was definitely diagnosed with isolated MS in the nasal cavity through immunohistochemistry combined with clinical features and radiological investigations, and MS further progressed to AML which was confirmed by hematologist. Endoscopic sinus surgery was performed to acquire specimens. After diagnosis, the patient was promptly treated with systemic chemotherapy. All symptoms gradually subsided and the mass of nasal cavity was invisible. No relapse occurred during follow-up. Sinonasal MS may be misdiagnosed and should be considered when symptoms persist and worsen. Prompt clinic examinations are essential for cases with suspected MS. Diagnosis of MS is dependent on the immunohistological investigations combined with clinical features, radiological investigations. Early diagnosis and systemic chemotherapy are vital for patients to achieve best prognosis.\n",

Patient was conservatively managed with intravenous (IV) antibiotics and was discharged on hospitalization day-6. Prior to scheduled interval appendectomy, he developed right sided hip pain with decreased range of motion. Computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast showed right hip abscess and enlarged pelvic lymph nodes. Arthrocentesis yielded purulent fluid with leukocytosis (84.8 k/CMM) and neutrophilia (89%). Patient underwent emergent incision and drainage of the hip abscess followed with 42-days of IV antibiotics for septic arthritis.

A fundus examination showed a large, yellowish-white, elevated, subretinal mass lesion in front of and inferior to the disc, with hemi-inferior-quadrant retinal detachment. The retina was greyish-yellow with scattered yellow spots. A vitrectomy with neoplasm resection was performed. A histopathologic examination revealed a GCT. The tumor cells were positive for CD68, NSE, S-100, and CD163 expression but negative for GFAP, Syn, and CD123 expression. The Ki-67 index was 1%. The right eye remained stable with visual acuity of no light perception at a 2-years follow-up. Intraocular GCT can present as a yellow-white solid mass with no calcification. Although intraocular GCT is very rare, it can lead to devastating visual loss. Intraocular GCT should be kept in mind and considered in clinical practice.\n",

      "Patients with malignant brain tumors have a poor prognosis. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is considered a primary obstacle in therapeutic drug delivery to the brain. Intra-arterial (IA) delivery of therapeutic agents following osmotic BBB opening has been attempted for years, but high variability has limited its widespread implementation. It has recently been shown in animal studies that MRI is superior to X-ray for guiding IA infusions, as it allows direct visualization of the brain parenchyma supplied by the catheter and facilitates predictable drug targeting. Moreover, PET imaging has shown that IA rather than intravenous delivery of bevacizumab results in accumulation in the brain, providing a strong rationale for using the IA route. We present a patient with recurrent butterfly glioblastoma enrolled in a first-in-man MRI-guided neurointervention for targeted IA drug delivery.\n",

We performed gross and histopathologic examination of eyes of children with suspected abusive head trauma and identified those with typical perimacular folds. Information was collected regarding the incident that led to the child's death and systemic manifestations noted at autopsy. Eyes were prepared in a fashion that allowed for demonstration of the vitreoretinal interface. Ten eyes of five patients (2-13 months) were examined. All patients had systemic manifestations of abusive trauma including intracranial injury. All cases provided evidence of vitreoretinal traction producing perimacular folds. Condensed vitreous was seen attached to the apices of the retinal folds, and the detached internal limiting membrane comprising the inner surfaces of the schisis cavity. Four cases showed severe bilateral multilayered symmetric retinal hemorrhages extending to the ora serrata. All cases showed optic nerve sheath subdural hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Orbital hemorrhage was unilateral in two cases and bilateral in three cases. Four cases showed orbital fat hemorrhage. One case showed extraocular muscle sheath and cranial nerve sheath hemorrhage. Two cases showed juxtapapillary intrascleral hemorrhage. Vitreoretinal traction is the likely mechanism of perimacular folds in abusive head trauma.\n",

      "Mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNENs) of the gallbladder are generally composed of adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC). Rare cases associated with intracholecystic papillary neoplasm (ICPN) have been reported. Although recent molecular data suggest that the different components of digestive MiNENs originate from a common precursor stem cell, this aspect has been poorly investigated in gallbladder MiNENs. We describe the clinicopathologic and molecular features of a MiNEN composed of ICPN, adenocarcinoma, and NEC. A 66-year-old woman presented with severe abdominal pain. She underwent radical cholecystectomy and an intracholecystic mass was found. Histologically, it was composed of ICPN associated with adenocarcinoma and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC). The three components were positive for DNA repair proteins and p53. EMA was positive in the ICPN and adenocarcinoma components, while it was negative in the LCNEC. Heterogeneous expression of Muc5AC, cytokeratin 20, and CDX2 was only observed in the ICPN component. Cytokeratin 7 was diffusely positive in both adenocarcinoma and LCNEC components, while it was heterogeneously expressed in the ICPN. The copy number variation analysis showed overlapping results between the adenocarcinoma and LCNEC components with some minor differences with the ICPN component. The three tumor components showed the same mutation profile including TP53 mutation c.700T > C (p. Tyr234His), without mutations in other 51 genes known to be frequently altered in cancer pathogenesis and growth. This finding may support the hypothesis of a monoclonal origin of the different tumor components. We have also performed a review of the literature on gallbladder MiNENs.\n",

      "Congenital gastrointestinal anomalies are common findings with relatively established methods of treatment. However, the genetic cause of how these defects occur and how that may impact a child's lifelong care is less established. Genetic testing has improved significantly in recent years, yet reviews documenting prenatal genetic counseling and testing guidelines have not been comprehensively updated. Congenital anomalies of the foregut, such as tracheoesophageal fistula carry a high association with genetic disorders, both in isolation and syndromic forms. Duodenal atresia remains highly associated with Trisomy 21 but is not enriched in other genetic conditions. Disorders of the midgut, such as omphalocele often have a genetic cause and may require both cytogenetic and panel testing to obtain a diagnosis. The etiologic basis of hindgut malformations remain largely unknown, though imperforate anus as well as Hirschprung's disease have been associated with many micro deletion syndromes as well as in association with other birth defects as part of larger syndromes. Prenatal diagnostic genetic testing through amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling can be offered to every patient who wants to learn genetic information about their fetus. Cytogenetic testing, such as microarray is a first tier test to assess cause for these conditions and can provide meaningful answers. When a gastrointestinal anomaly is identified in association with an additionally affected organ system next-generation sequencing and defect-specific genetic testing panels can be necessary to understand cause as well as prognosis to best prepare families for the medical management that lies ahead.\n",

Although its clinical presentation and radiographic findings are similar to other nutrient deficiencies, practitioners often fail to diagnose copper deficiency. This report describes a case of copper deficiency decades after a jejunoileal bypass (JIB) to draw attention to potential long-term sequelae associated with this now abandoned procedure. A 67-year-old female presented with bilateral paresthesias of her hands and legs, accompanied by gait instability and frequent falls. The individual had a significant history of malabsorption and malnutrition related to a 40 years prior JIB for weight loss. MRI demonstrated T2 hyperintense signal in the dorsal spinal cord between C3 and C5. She was found to have copper deficiency, underwent IV repletion, prescribed oral repletion, and was discharged home. She subsequently developed progressive symptoms over the following year and remained unable to function at home. Treatment required inpatient copper repletion followed by inpatient rehabilitation. Following rehabilitation, the individual demonstrated significant improved independence. Although JIB surgery is not currently performed, it is important to recognize the metabolic consequences of nutrient deficiencies related to this procedure and the potential for the development of neurological sequelae including myelopathy. Furthermore, additional causes of copper deficiency to consider in cases of undifferentiated myelopathy include congenital metabolic syndromes, zinc toxicity, and malabsorption. This case demonstrates the potential of intensive physical and occupational therapy regimens, along with symptomatic treatment and nutrient repletion, to help an individual regain independence and improve activities of daily living.\n",

      "The Thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb) is the main driver of Graves' disease (GD) and its most common extra-thyroidal manifestation: thyroid eye disease (TED). Though key to diagnosis, it has not been used routinely as a marker of disease activity or to guide treatment. Here we demonstrate, through a retrospective review of 105 patients with TED, that serial TRAb levels vary with time, correlate with disease activity and are affected by smoking and endocrine control. Such serial measurements can guide the modern management of thyroid eye disease, helping to prevent the more serious manifestations. We show that surgical thyroidectomy is associated with a reduction in antibody levels and a reduced rate of TED reactivation when compared to radio-iodine ablation where the stimulating antigen is not removed. This provides a molecular explanation for epidemiological studies showing radio-ablation being associated with an increased risk of orbitopathy. To demonstrate the effect of our clinical approach on a patient population, we then compared the incidence and severity of TED in a clinic in a period before and after the introduction of serial TRAb measurements. Despite an increase in disease incidence and severity at presentation over the two-decade study period, our approach saw a significant reduction in the need for surgical intervention for this orbital disorder.\n",

We analyzed MRI. We reviewed all published SPG7 mutations for correlations. We identified 42 cases with biallelic SPG7 mutations, including 7 novel mutations, including a large multi-exon deletion, representing one of the largest cohorts so far described. We identified a characteristic phenotype comprising cerebellar ataxia with prominent cerebellar dysarthria, mild lower limb spasticity, and a waddling gait, predominantly from a cohort of idiopathic ataxia. We report a rare brain MRI finding of dentate nucleus hyperintensity on T2 sequences with SPG7 mutations. We confirm that the c.1529C>T allele is frequently present in patients with long-standing British ancestry. Based on the findings of the present study and existing literature, we confirm that patients with homozygous mutations involving the M41 peptidase domain of SPG7 have a younger age at onset compared to individuals with mutations elsewhere in the gene (14 years difference, p < 0.034), whereas c.1529C>T compound heterozygous mutations are associated with a younger age at onset compared to homozygous cases (5.4 years difference, p < 0.022). Mutant SPG7 is common in sporadic ataxia. In patients with British ancestry, c.1529C>T allele represents the most frequent mutation.

      "Neonatal thrombotic microangiopathy secondary to factor I variant with Hirschsprung disease.\n",
      "Neonatal thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a rare and severe disease characterized by a triad of non-immune hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and organ dysfunction in neonates. We describe herein an early-term infant who underwent hemicolectomy at 4 days of age due to intestinal perforation. Following surgery, the patient had recurrent bouts of vomiting and abdominal distention, together with acute kidney injury, non-immune hemolytic anemia, and severe thrombocytopenia. Low complement levels raised the possibility of complement-mediated neonatal TMA. Finally, genetic tests identified a heterozygous mutation in the complement factor I gene. Anti-C5 monoclonal antibody therapy led to complete cessation of the hematological and renal manifestations, but symptoms of intestinal obstruction recurred. Intestinal biopsy demonstrated aganglionosis, compatible with Hirschsprung disease. This presentation is the first known case of neonatal complement-mediated TMA associated with Hirschsprung disease. Moreover, it highlights the importance of considering a diagnosis of TMA in cases of atypical neonatal infectious presentation.\n",

      "Hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (HSOS) can be caused by the intake of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs). To date, PAs-induced HSOS has not been extensively studied. In view of the difference in etiology of HSOS between the West and China, clinical profiles, imaging findings, treatment, and outcomes of HSOS associated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or oxaliplatin might be hardly extrapolated to PAs-induced HSOS. Reactive metabolites derived from PAs form pyrrole-protein adducts that result in toxic destruction of hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells. PAs-induced HSOS typically manifests as painful hepatomegaly, ascites, and jaundice. Laboratory tests revealed abnormal liver function tests were observed in most of the patients with PAs-induced HSOS. In addition, contrast computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scan show that patients with PAs-induced HSOS have distinct imaging features, which reveal that radiological imaging provides an effective noninvasive method for the diagnosis of PAs-induced HSOS. Liver biopsy and histological examination showed that PAs-induced HSOS displayed distinct features in acute and chronic stages. Therapeutic strategies for PAs-induced HSOS include rigorous fluid management, anticoagulant therapy, glucocorticoids, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, liver transplantation, etc. The aim of this review is to describe the pathogenesis, clinical profiles, diagnostic criteria, treatment, and outcomes of PAs-induced HSOS.\n",

      "Pelvic floor dysfunction is a relatively common but often complex condition, presenting with a variety of clinical symptoms, especially when it involves multiple compartments. Clinical exam alone is often inadequate and requires a complementary imaging study. Magnetic resonance defecography (MRD) is an excellent noninvasive diagnostic study with its multiplanar capability, lack of ionizing radiation and excellent soft tissue resolution. It can identify both anatomic and functional abnormalities in the pelvic floor and specifically excels in its ability to simultaneously detect multicompartmental pathology and help with vital pre-operative assessment. This manuscript reviews the relevant anatomical landmarks, describes the optimal technique, highlights an approach to the interpretation of MRD, and provides an overview of the various pelvic floor disorders in the different anatomical compartments.\n",

      "This case shows an atypical presentation of an osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) lesion of the radial head with detachment diagnosed on plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). OCD lesions are rather uncommon in the elbow joint; however, when present, these lesions are typically seen in throwing athletes or gymnasts who engage in activities involving repetitive trauma to the elbow. Involvement of the radial head is extremely rare, accounting for <5% of all elbow OCD lesions. Conventional radiographs have low sensitivity for detecting OCD lesions and may frequently miss these lesions in the early stages. MRI, the imaging modality of choice, can detect these lesions at the earliest stage and provide a clear picture of the involved articular cartilage and underlying bone. Treatment options can vary between nonoperative and operative management depending on several factors, including age and activity level of the patient, size and type of lesion, and clinical presentation. This case represents a radial head OCD lesion managed by arthroscopic débridement alone, resulting in a positive outcome.\n",

      "The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors has revolutionized cancer treatment. These novel agents have provided promising treatment options in patients with different types of cancers. One of these agents is pembrolizumab, which works by blocking the binding of T-lymphocytes to programmed cell death ligand 1 receptors on tumor cells, thus enabling immune activation of T-lymphocytes against tumor cells. Pembrolizumab is commonly used in metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer and melanoma. However, despite the remarkable efficacy this agent has achieved, multiple immune-related adverse events have been reported including hepatitis, colitis, thyroid dysfunction, and pneumonitis. Only 2 other cases of pericardial effusion as a side effect of pembrolizumab have been cited in the literature; however, its incidence may be on the rise. Despite the rarity of this side effect, its complications are potentially life threatening and no clear platform currently exists to help guide healthcare professionals in the management of these adverse events. Herein we present the case of a 66-year-old female who developed pericardial effusion as a side effect of pembrolizumab and review the data currently available to assist in the management of this life-threatening condition.\n",

      "[Meningitis Due to Streptococcus pneumoniae Serotype 24B in a Patient with Cochlear Implant Previously Vaccinated with the Pneumococcal Vaccine].\n",
      "Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of bacterial meningitis in children. It can progress and carries a serious risk of mortality and morbidity despite effective treatment. Cochlear implantation is a fairly successful procedure for restoring hearing in cases of sensorineural hearing loss. Moreover, patients with cochlear implants are at increased risk of contracting pneumococcal meningitis compared to the general population. The development of meningitis is associated with pathogens in the middle ear that contaminate the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as a result of congenital anomalies in the cochlea, and the cochlear implant. A 4-year-old girl presented to our clinic with fever, vomiting, and weakness. A physical examination showed an axillary temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 134/min, respiration rate of 50 breaths/minute, and arterial blood pressure of 120/88 mmHg. The patient also had a neck stiffness and her Kernig and Brudzinski signs were positive. It was discovered that the patient had undergone cochlear implantation approximately five months prior due to bilateral congenital sensorineural hearing loss. She had also received the Haemophilus influenzae type b and PCV-13 vaccines in line with the national immunization calendar. Her laboratory findings showed a leukocyte count of 21.900/mm3 (neutrophils 90% and lymphocytes 10%) and her procalcitonin level was 1.22 ng/ml. An uncountable number of neutrophils was identified in her cerebrospinal fluid, which led to the initial diagnosis of meningitis. There was also 1 mg/dl of glucose (blood glucose, 102 mg/dl) and 706 mg/dl of protein in her cerebrospinal fluid. Empirically, vancomycin (60 mg/kg/day) and ceftriaxone (100 mg/kg/day) were started. Following 5 days of antibiotic treatment, penicillin-susceptible S.pneumoniae was yielded in her CSF culture and identified as serotype 24B. S.pneumoniae with the same antibiotic sensitivity was also identified in her blood culture. Since rhinorrhea was observed on day 16 of hospitalization, she underwent an operation to repair the fistula tract. A computerized tomography cranial scan was performed after the development of acute mental fog at postoperative day 3 and showed brain edema and a thrombus in the right middle cerebral artery. The patient died on day 42 of hospitalization due to multiple organ failure. To our knowledge, this is the first case of meningitis reported in our country associated with S.pneumoniae serotype 24B in a patient with a cochlear implant. While there has been a decrease in the prevalence of invasive pneumococcal disease with routine administration of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, a relative increase has been observed in its non-vaccine serotypes. This is relevant not only to patients with more risk factors, such as a cochlear implant, but also those who are at lower risk for pneumococcal infection.\n",

      "We report a patient for whom a colonic stent was successfully used to treat colonic stenosis secondary to acute pancreatitis. A 70-year-old male presented with epigastric pain. A choledocholith and bile duct dilatation were found on abdominal computed tomography scan. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed and a common bile duct stent was placed. Ten hours after stent placement, severe epigastric pain developed. Contrast enhanced abdominal computed tomography scan revealed increased density of fat tissue around the pancreas. He was diagnosed with severe acute pancreatitis and treated in the intensive care unit. On the twenty-eighth hospital day, he vomited. His abdomen was distended and tender to palpation. Contrast enhanced abdominal computed tomography scan revealed stenosis of the descending colon and proximally dilated colon and small bowel. He was diagnosed with colonic stenosis secondary to acute pancreatitis. A colonic stent was placed in the descending colon. Eight months after this episode, elective subtotal colectomy was performed. The postoperative course was unremarkable. The overall documented leak rate for segmental colectomy with or without on-table lavage following large bowel obstruction is about 4%. In addition, in the acute phase of severe acute pancreatitis, inflammation makes surgery difficult. Use of enteric stents in patients with pancreatitis could be used as a temporizing measure until the inflammation and obstruction improve. Colonic stenting is useful as a bridge to surgery in the management of large bowel obstruction.\n",

      "Foreign body granuloma is an inflammatory tissue reaction to exogenous material. Classically it appears on the face after aesthetic procedures. Herein we report for the first time three cases of facial granulomatous reactions to microbeads after arterial cervico-facial embolization. Three patients underwent embolization of the facial arteries using Embogold® microbeads in a setting of epistaxis or tumoral hemostasis. Within 10 to 45 days painful, inflammatory, subcutaneous nodules appeared on the homolateral side of the face. Histological samples showed an inflammatory response with giant cells as well as the presence of microbeads in the skin. A favorable outcome was achieved with colchicine in one patient and with surgery in another; the third patient was lost to follow-up. The embolizing microspheres produced a local inflammatory reaction, with destruction of the vascular wall and bead migration to facial tissue leading to a granulomatous reaction. The occurrence of three cases within a period of few weeks, with several different operators and batches of products, is surprising considering the long-standing use of the product. There was no common comorbidity in the patients and no suggestion of trauma. Retrospective analysis of the product batches was normal. Gold staining could play a role in severe inflammatory response to Embogold® particles. These three cases illustrate the value of discussing potential foreign body granulomatous reaction in cases of facial nodules following cervico-facial embolization. Colchicine may offer a valuable therapeutic alternative.\n",

      "A 2-year-old Pomeranian goose ( Anser anser) weighing 8.1 kg was examined because of non-weight-bearing lameness of the right limb. A closed, transverse, diaphyseal fracture of the distal third of the right tibiotarsus with a craniolateral displacement of the distal fragment was diagnosed radiographically. Surgery under general anesthesia was performed to repair the fracture with a 14-hole, 2.7-mm locking plate fixed with 6 screws in a bicortical manner. Two days later, the bird was fully weight-bearing on the leg. Radiographs performed 4 and 8 weeks after surgery showed good healing of the affected bone with an appropriate callus formation bridging the fracture line. Sixteen weeks after surgery, the patient was readmitted because of lameness exhibited while staying outside exposed to subzero (°C) temperatures. On the basis of this finding, heat conduction was postulated as the possible cause of lameness because it disappeared after implant removal. To the best our knowledge, this case represents the first report of a surgical repair of a tibiotarsal fracture with a locking plate in waterfowl.\n",

      "Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is a heterogeneous disease, and its pathogenesis remains controversial. This study aimed to examine the involvement of fungi in CRSwNP pathogenesis. We enrolled 29 controls and 111 CRSwNP patients. We analyzed fungi in the nasal secretions, serum fungus-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, and nasal polyp (NP) IgE levels. Moreover, we evaluated the correlation between patients' IgE levels and computed tomography (CT) scores. There was no difference in fungal detection rate between CRSwNP patients with and without asthma. Specific IgEs against various antigens were highly detectable in NPs of CRSwNP patients. In CRSwNP patients, fungus-specific IgE levels in NPs were correlated with CT scores. Serum fungus-specific IgEs became undetectable after operation in more than half of the CRSwNP patients without asthma but not in those with asthma. Other serum airborne antigen-specific IgEs did not become undetectable after operation. Fungus-specific IgEs were highly detectable in NPs of CRSwNP patients, and NPs comprised a major region of specific IgE production. Fungi may therefore play an important role in CRSwNP pathogenesis by inducing Th2 immune responses, including IgE synthesis.\n",

Surgery is required when these tumors behave aggressively and grow rapidly or when they are large enough to cause compression symptoms. Several surgical approaches have been described to resect such lesions. We present a case of a solitary intraorbital myofibroma extending into the optic canal in a 6-year-old girl that was completely resected via an extended endonasal endoscopic approach.

Fifty-two cases were diagnosed, including five deaths. We performed an epidemiological investigation and prepared a map of the places cases visited during the incubation period. All sites identified as potential sources were investigated and sampled. Association between heavy rainfall and LD cases was evaluated in a case-crossover study. We also performed a case-control study and an aerosol dispersion investigation model. Lp1 was isolated from 22 of 598 analysed water samples; four clinical isolates were typed using monoclonal antibodies and sequence-based typing. Four Lp1 human strains were ST23, of which two were Philadelphia and two were France-Allentown subgroup. Lp1 ST23 France-Allentown was isolated only from a public fountain. In the case-crossover study, extreme precipitation 5-6 days before symptom onset was associated with increased LD risk. The aerosol dispersion model showed that the fountain matched the case distribution best. The case-control study demonstrated a significant eightfold increase in risk for cases residing near the public fountain. The three studies and the matching of clinical and environmental Lp1 strains identified the fountain as the source responsible for the epidemic.\n",

      "Correction of rigid clubfoot in an older child by gradual differential distraction using the Ilizarov's device or Joshi's external stabilization system (JESS) is a time-consuming procedure. We simultaneously combined the lateral column shortening by cuboid wedge resection along with the differential distraction by application of JESS fixator for the treatment of severe, rigid, neglected, or relapsed congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV) foot deformity in 30 feet in 18 children with mean age of 5.3 years and mean follow-up of 27.6 months. The mean pretreatment Pirani score was 5.3 which improved to mean Pirani score after treatment of 1.4. Excellent results were obtained in 22 (71.33%) feet, good results in four (13.33%) feet, and poor results in four (13.33%) feet. The average period for distraction in our series was 6.3 weeks, and total average period of fixator in place was 11.2 weeks. To conclude, lateral column shortening with JESS application simultaneously gives early good to excellent short-term results, and the combination of techniques permits rapid correction of deformity, and thus reducing the time for which the fixator is in place and hence has better acceptance by the patient.\n",
